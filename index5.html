Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla Firefox.[15] Versions were later released for Linux, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and also for Android, where it is the default browser.[16] The browser is also the main component of ChromeOS, where it serves as the platform for web applications.

Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's free and open-source software project Chromium, but Chrome is licensed as proprietary freeware.[14] WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google eventually forked it to create the Blink engine;[17] all Chrome variants except iOS used Blink as of 2017.[18]

As of April 2024, StatCounter estimates that Chrome has a 65% worldwide browser market share (after peaking at 72.38% in November 2018) on personal computers (PC),[19] is most used on tablets (having surpassed Safari), and is also dominant on smartphones.[20][21] With a market share of 65% across all platforms combined, Chrome is the most used web browser in the world today.[22]

Google chief executive Eric Schmidt was previously involved in the "browser wars", a part of U.S. corporate history, and opposed the expansion of the company into such a new area. However, Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page spearheaded a software demonstration that pushed Schmidt into making Chrome a core business priority, which resulted in commercial success.[23] Because of the proliferation of Chrome, Google has expanded the "Chrome" brand name to other products. These include not just ChromeOS but also Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox, and Chromebase.</div>
